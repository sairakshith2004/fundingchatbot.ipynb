# fundingchatbot.ipynb💬 AI-Powered Funding Recommendation Chatbot
This project is an intelligent chatbot system that helps innovators, students, and startups in India find relevant funding institutions based on their project ideas. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP), the chatbot analyzes a user's input and suggests government, CSR, and private funding organizations across domains like technology, healthcare, environment, education, and agriculture.

🚀 Features
🔍 Understands natural language project descriptions
📚 Matches your project to relevant funding sectors
🏛️ Recommends funding bodies with additional info
📄 Displays application steps for selected institutions
🧠 Uses tokenization, stopword filtering, and fuzzy matching
💡 Runs easily on Google Colab or local Python environment
📌 Technologies Used
Python 3
NLTK – for text preprocessing
FuzzyWuzzy – for fuzzy keyword matching
Text Files – for funding info and application steps
🛠️ How It Works
User describes their project idea (e.g., "AI app for rural farmers").
Input is tokenized and cleaned using NLTK.
Tokens are matched to a keyword-category mapping.
